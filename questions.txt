Question2:
Sub1: "A forensic technician notes that the victim's blood oxygen levels were critically low at the time of death. Considering the primary function of the respiratory system, which process was most likely severely impaired?"

(B) Trachea and Esophagus
(C) Bronchioles and Pulmonary capillaries
(D) Ribs and Intercostal muscles

(B) Smooth muscle lining the bronchioles
(C) Thin-walled sacs surrounded by capillaries 
(D) Ciliated epithelium of the airways
3
Clue5: The killer understood the basic mechanism of oxygen exchange in the lungs.
Question3:
1. Put the following organs in the correct order based on when they become involved in digestion: Mouth Large Intestine Small Intestine
Esophagus

2. Organize the following structures in the correct sequence: Rectum Esophagus Anus Stomach

3. Sequence the organs in the order where enzymatic digestion primarily occurs: Mouth Small Intestine Stomach Esophagus

4. Place these digestive parts in the order food encounters them: Pharynx Large Intestine Stomach Small Intestine

5. Arrange these parts in the correct order of function during digestion: Mouth Rectum
Esophagus Large Intestine
